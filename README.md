# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 

This analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used 6 different methods, which are:

Naive Random Oversampling

SMOTE Oversampling

Cluster Centroid Undersampling

SMOTEENN Sampling

Balanced Random Forest Classifying

Easy Ensemble Classifying

Through each of these methods, I split my data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports as my results.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
