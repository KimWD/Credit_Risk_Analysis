# Credit_Risk_Analysis

# Overview of the analysis: 

This analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used 6 different methods, which are:

Naive Random Oversampling
SMOTE Oversampling
Cluster Centroid Undersampling
SMOTEENN Sampling
Balanced Random Forest Classifying
Easy Ensemble Classifying

Through each of these methods, I split my data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports as my results.

# Results: 

**Native Randon Oversampling**


Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

# Summary: 

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
